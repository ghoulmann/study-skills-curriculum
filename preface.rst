Problem
=======

Basic organization and study skills are not directly taught to students setting the students up for academic stress and possibly failure.  This is exacerbated in students with language-based learning differences, attention issues and executive functioning difficulties.

Rationale
=========

The key to creating academically successful and independent students, no matter their strengths and weaknesses, depends on students building a repository of self-sufficient study and organization skills which can be utilized across the curriculum.


Values
======

* Equity
* Contructivist pedagogy
* Literacy (reading and writing) across the curriculum
* citizenship
* Authentic learning and assessment [narrowly defined; distinguished from project & performance-based assessment]
